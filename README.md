### Instructions
1.  Clone tdl-demo repository.
2. Don't try to install TopoNetX repo. I think there's still a bug that causes toponetx.datasets.mesh causes to crash.
3. Clone and install TopoModelX following this link [https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX/tree/main](https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX/tree/main). 
4. Run [./ltn_train.ipynb](./ltn_train.ipynb) for a small guide.

### Requirements
```
python >= 3.10
pytorch >= 2.0.1
cuda = 11.7
```
